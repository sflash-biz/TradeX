                                   <br><br>

                                   <div class="message-notice">
                                     Each trade can have it's own trigger strings as well so they can be customized as needed for each site!
                                   </div>
                                 </span><br>

        <b>Maximum Dimensions -</b> <span>The maximum image size that should be considered a valid thumbnail to grab</span><br>
        <b>mogrify Path -</b> <span>
                                The full directory path to the ImageMagick mogrify program on your server.

                                <br><br>

                                <div class="message-notice">
                                  You can use the <img src="../images/test-16x16.png" style="margin: 0;"> icon to have the software check the path you have entered.
                                  If you are told that the path is invalid, it could be caused by a number of things:

                                  <br><br>

                                  <ol>
                                    <li> ImageMagick may not be installed on your server</li>
                                    <li> Your server may have an older version of ImageMagick installed.  Thumbnail resizing requires version 6.3.9 or newer</li>
                                    <li> If PHP is running with safe_mode enabled, you will not be able to use mogrify to resize the thumbnails</li>
                                  </ol>

                                  <br>

                                  Thumbnail resizing can also be done using the GD extension for PHP.  If PHP is setup with the GD extension including JPEG support
                                  you will get a message saying that GD will be used for resizing instead of mogrify.
                                </div>
                              </span><br>

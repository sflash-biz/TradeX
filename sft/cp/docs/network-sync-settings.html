      </ul>

      The syncing process can take a while to complete, so be sure that you stay on this page until it has finished.  A progress indicator will appear at the top of the page after you click
      on the sync icon.  This will tell you what site is currently being synced and will also show you the sync results.  If there were no errors during the sync, this will disappear when it
      has completed and a confirmation message will display in the top right of your web browser.

      <br><br/>

      If there were errors, you will still be able to see this section after syncing has completed so you can review the results to see which site(s) had problems and what they were.

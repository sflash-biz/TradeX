                             These will be used in addition to the global Trigger Strings setting, so it is not necessary to duplicate
                             those values in this field.  This field should only be used if you need to setup a custom trigger string
                             for a trade.

        <b>Instant -</b> <span>
                           Use this to force a set number of outs to a trade.  Once this number has been reached, the force will be disabled.
                           If you select the high-priority option, this trade will be put on top of the main outlist so it will receive these
                           forced outs sooner.  Without that option, the trade will be in the regular forces outlist.
                         </span><br>
        <b>Hourly -</b> <span>Use this to force a set number of outs to a trade every hour.  You can specify the date and time when this force
                        should end, or leave that value blank to have it continue until you manually set this force back to 0.</span><br>

        <b>Weight -</b> <span>Assign a weight to this trade.  If you want a trade to have a higher priority than others, enter a value larger than 100.  To have a lower priority, enter a value less than 100.</span><br>
        <b>Push To -</b> <span>Use this to set the number of ins you want to push this trade to.  This will give the trade an extra out boost so you will get more ins.  Once
                         the push value has been reached, the trade will get traffic as normal.</span><br>
        <b>Push Weight -</b> <span>This weight value will be used for a trade that is being pushed until it reaches it's push to value.  Once it does, the regular weight value will take over.</span><br>

        <b>Hourly Cap -</b> <span>Specify the maximum return percentage a trade can reach in a 60 minute period.  If this value is exceeded, the trade will not get any more outs until it falls back below this maximum.</span><br>
        <b>Daily Cap -</b> <span>Specify the maximum return percentage a trade can reach in a 24 hour period.  If this value is exceeded, the trade will not get any more outs until it falls back below this maximum.</span><br>
        <b>Exclude Trades -</b> <span>Select the trade(s) where surfers coming from this site should not be sent.</span><br>
        <b>External Info -</b> <span>The external info feature is used to make sure that a surfer doesn't get sent back to the same trade even after they have visited many of your trades.  For example,
                                if a surfer comes from trade #1, gets sent to trade #2, and then gets sent on to trade #3 from trade #2, the external info feature can tell the script that the surfer has been to
                                all three of these trades so it won't get sent back to them.  Each of the trade sites needs to be using a script that supports the External Info feature.</span><br>

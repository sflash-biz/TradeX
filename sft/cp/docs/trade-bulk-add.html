      Use this dialog to add several trades at once.  This dialog will have the same settings as the <a href="trade-add.html">Add a Trade</a> dialog, but will allow you to enter
      import data to add multiple trades with one click.  The following additional fields are on this dialog:

      <ul>
        <b>Separator -</b> <span>Select the character being used to separate each field of trade data</span><br>
        <b>Fields -</b> <span>Select the fields in the order they appear in your import data</span><br>
        <b>Trade data -</b> <span>Enter the data you are importing</span><br>
      </ul>

      For example, say you have some import data that looks like this:

      <xmp class="code">Site #1;http://www.site1.com/index.shtml;jeff@site1.com;Jeff
Site #2;http://www.site2.com/index.shtml;george@site2.com;George
Site #3;http://www.site3.com/index.shtml;sam@site3.com;Sam
</xmp>

      For the Separator you would select <b><i>Semicolon (;)</i></b><br>
      For the Fields you would select <b><i>Site Name</i></b>, <b><i>Return URL</i></b>, <b><i>E-mail</i></b>, <b><i>Nick</i></b>, and <b><i>None</i></b> for the remaining<br>
      For the Trade data you would paste the import data from above

      <br><br>

      Once you have the import data configured, you can adjust the remaining settings as you like.  Those same settings will then be used for each trade that is imported.
